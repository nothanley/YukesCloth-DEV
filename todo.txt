notes:
- simlinktar
	has index table then skin weights	
	
colvtx buffer-
	1st buffer is defined as coltable
	vertex matrices are loaded
	
- colvtx
	seems to be every edge associated with a vertex is listed.
	these might be edges? includes two floats. Not sure.
	index table

- skinpaste
	/* Topmost (simless) vertices. index table */
	/* Seems to be vertices that will be unaffected by the sim */
	build an index table, add to json
- oldvtxsave
	/* For M_ meshes, every vert is saved. But on sim meshes, only the simless verts
	   are saved.	*/
	build an index table, add to json
	
- rcn buffer
	deals with face normals
	
	NOTE: 2/17- The face link buffer might seemingly refer to the index of a quad polygon in the 
				predefined quad indice stream. Although they don't need to be quads, but the values seem
				to match. So, aggregate the poly indices and evaluate what the facelink buffer points to
				
				- Update:
					so, it seems that whats really happening is you are going through every vertex
					and listing out every quad poly that shares a point with this and setting the face 
					list for the vertex index
